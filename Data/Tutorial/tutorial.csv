WHAT IS THE GAME?
In Zombie in my Pocket, you're searching for the secret of the evil temple where you can find the item to destroy
the zombies rising from the dead. You can pick up items to bash zombies along the way; a machete, golf club, chain saw
or even your former uncle's grisly femur.

Find the zombie totem, then bury it in the backyard graveyard before midnight and you've saved the world.
Otherwise, you're zombie food.
